# Flight-Booking-System
Intro to OOD in C++. Programme allows users to book, create, cancel flights, etc.

To run: make run 
Make your terminal slightly larger, so you can see the seating chart! 
You can filter flights and view passengers. There are some filled in upon startup. 
You can work off Passenger 123456 and Flight F1234. 
Don't forget to play around with the filters. Not all airports are in the system, just a select few.
